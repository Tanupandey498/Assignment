        "Q1. What is Multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the Module Used to Handle Threads in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Multithreading in Python is a technique where multiple threads (smaller units of a process) are created to execute tasks concurrently. A thread is a separate flow of execution within a program. In Python, multithreading allows multiple parts of the program to run concurrently, but due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.\n",

        "  \n",
        "**I/O-bound Tasks:**  It is particularly useful when the program has I/O-bound tasks like file reading, network requests, or waiting for user input, as threads can execute while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",

        "**Better Resource Utilization:** It can help make better use of system resources and improve the efficiency of programs that are not CPU-bound.\n",
