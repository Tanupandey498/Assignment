        "\n",
        "Ans: Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to create multiple processes that can run simultaneously. Each process runs in its own memory space and can execute independently of the others. Python’s multiprocessing module allows the creation of processes, enabling parallel execution of tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is it useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **True Parallelism:** Unlike threads (which are constrained by Python’s Global Interpreter Lock or GIL), processes can achieve true parallelism because each process runs in its own memory space and has its own Python interpreter.\n",
        "- **Performance Boost for CPU-bound Tasks:** It is especially useful for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., mathematical computations, data processing) because multiple processes can fully utilize multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "- **Fault Isolation:** If one process crashes, it doesn’t affect the other processes. This isolation helps with fault tolerance.\n",

        "The multiprocessing module in Python allows easy management of multiple processes.\n",
